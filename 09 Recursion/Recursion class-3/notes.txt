Substring:

"Racecar"

Substring can be : "R" , "Rac", "cec" , "car" etc.
A Substring has to be continous.

Subsequence:
"Love"

Subsequence can be : "Lo", "Loe", "Le" etc

"abc"

Subsequence can be : "a" , "b", "c" , "ab" , "bc" , "ac" , "abc" , "" . 

Subsequence do not have to be continous but it should maintain the order of the original string.
like if a comes before b in original string the in the Subsequence also a should come before b.

Total no. of Subsequences are : 2^n , where n = length of the string

Example: 

                                "xy"

                inc                               Excl
            "xy", "x"  
                                                "xy", ""
         inc         Excl              inc                     Excl
        "xy","xy"  "xy", "x"       "xy", "y"               "xy", ""

Total Subsequences : xy, x, y, "" = 4 = 2^2 = 2^n

n = length of string
